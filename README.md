About the Video Course
Django is one of the world's leading web development platforms that follows the model-view-template development method. This Python web framework makes your app building experience smoother, faster, and easier. It has been and continues to be the key feature behind the success of many start-ups across the world.

Mastering Django Web Development shows you how to use advanced concepts to help you build professional grade Django applications.

We start off by learning how class-based views work so that you can fully benefit from this powerful, but often poorly understood feature. We’ll then create custom middleware which will help us better organize frequently used code.

Have you ever wanted to build a complete REST API? We’ll do just that, starting out with a basic read-only API and then adding key-based authentication to allow the full range of CRUD functionality. We’ll also utilize model managers and the Q method so that we can make it easier to get the data we need to our views and clients.

For the finishing touches, we’ll dive into the details of caching, to improve our application performance, and then add custom management commands to help us automate routine tasks.

By the end of this video course, you will emerge a Django expert.
